1. **Header:** The Comments header tallies the total comments. There is no known limit to the number of comments.

  - Users Avatar on Comment - a default avatar should be provided. (Optional: Avatar displayed with the commenting entry field)
  -  Name
  - Date and time stamp, for when the comment was entered or last modified. (Time date stamp presentation may vary on usage to match time date stamp system of existing application.)
  - Text for the comment.
  - The order of the list of comments will be latest to oldest, from top to bottom, by default. The order of the list may be reviewed, to determine if the environment in which it is used, would best support latest to last or last to latest.
  **Buttons**
   - (optional)The appearance of the buttons as text or icons.
   - (optional) Placement of the command buttons below or to the right of the text entry field.
   - (optional) Cancel button is optional, as backspace can achieve the same effect, it just will most likely require more keystrokes.

### What’s not covered in the current design but will be covered in future sprints:

The following functionality is not covered in this pattern:

1. Scrolling, as this action should be suitable to how and where comments are utilized. The comments may have a scroll bar or may be infinite scroll, depending upon how they are being used.
2. Replying to a comment or threading a comment has not yet been designed it this basic commenting pattern.
3. Attachments has not been designed into this basic pattern.
4. We have only provided placement of the Time and date stamp format and rules, as requirements for these can greatly vary.
